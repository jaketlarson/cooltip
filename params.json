{"name":"Cooltip.js","tagline":"Lightweight, jQuery tooltip plugin","body":"### What is Cooltip?\r\nCooltip is a lightweight jQuery plugin for creating tooltips on the fly. There are many tooltip plugins out there, but I needed something simple and with more than just a side of the element (top, right, bottom, or left) the tooltip shows on. I wanted the option to align the body of the tooltip in a certain direction. This is especially helpful for icons on the top right of the page, so the tooltip doesn't overflow. I figured I'd share my flavor of a tooltip with anyone who finds it useful.\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\nDemo on this page coming soon.. for now, just use the demo page provided in the repo.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\nOptions documentation coming soon.\r\n\r\n### Download / Implementation\r\nTo plug & play, download the package (button on the right) and use the cooltip.js and cooltip.css files within the \"dist\" folder.\r\n\r\nDevelopment instructions available on the GitHub repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/jaketlarson/cooltip\r\n\r\n### Contributions / Maintenance\r\nCooltip is fairly new, and I'm sure there are plenty of bugs already.  I am going to be using this as my go-to tooltip component in my dev projects (that's why I built it), so when I find bugs I will address them. If you find Cooltip useful and have bugs or ideas, feel free to <a href=\"https://github.com/jaketlarson/cooltip/issues\">open an issue</a>. I'll add to the issues as I find bugs, as well. \r\n\r\n### License / Copyright\r\n&copy;2015 Jake Larson.
